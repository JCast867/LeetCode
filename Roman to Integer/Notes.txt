Going to have to make a variable to keep track of the total.

Then you can loop through each letter. Using a while loop was much simpler to implement.
So while i < the length of the string (s), you look for each value and see if they match with a certain letter.
So M for 1000, D for 500, etc, etc. However, some values like I, X, and C can be put in front of other letters and not add to the total value.
Instead, it'd subtract. So we have to check if there's some values in front of these to see if it'll change the meaning of the total.
Then, return the total.
