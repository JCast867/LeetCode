Having a dictionary is useful here because it'll help us check if the key (average) is inside the dictionary or not.
Since we have to remove the max and min each time, a while loop would fit this situation better.
We can check while the list is not empty, find the min and max, get the average, and add the average to the distionary if it doesnt exist already.
Then we can remove the min and max and after the while loop is over, return the length of the distionary since that'll be how much
distinct averages we have in total.
